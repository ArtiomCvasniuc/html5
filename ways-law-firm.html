                    <p class="title">Ways That A Law Firm Can Get Leads Through Pay-Per-Click Advertising</p>
                    <p>
                        The survival of any law firm depends on the business it conducts. A good law firm needs to be in the position of getting new clients. According to statistics, the law business is one of the most competitive fields in the US. We have over 1.5 million lawyers across the country, who are all competing for the same market. If a law firm wants to stay in business and remain relevant, it has to attract more clients every day. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Marketing your law business requires adopting new techniques that will set you apart from your competition. You need to offer your clients more than your competitors. You must position your business in a strategic position to take advantage of the emerging markets. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Acquiring business leads is the first step in bringing in new clients. Twenty quality leads are worth more than five clients. When you employ better marketing and follow up tactics, you can convert over 60 percent of your leads into your clients. That’s why you must concentrate on bringing in new leads to your business every day.

                    <br />
                    <p class="title">What is a Lead?</p>
                    <p>
                        When you market your business, and someone shows interest in your services, they usually provide you with their contact details. Some will give you a phone number or an email. Others will provide you with both. You can then use the contact information to follow up with them. It’s during this period where you convince them to become your clients. Whenever someone offers you their contact details, it signals that they have opened the first door and are willing to listen to you. You can convert them to long-term clients by using advanced marketing strategies. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="title">How do you Collect Leads?</p>
                    <p>
                        Any lead collection method can work as long as there is the traffic of people. You can collect the leads from your website, pay for ads, or use social platforms. However, setting up a lead collection system is very important. Investing in a sound system will ensure you get better leads. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="title">Have a Lead Magnet</p>
                    <p>
                        People will not provide you with their contact details if they are not getting something in return. That’s where a lead magnet comes in. A lead magnet could be anything of value to your clients. You may decide to give them a copy of your book for free if they sign up to your email list. It can also be a video course, a cheat shit, or even a free consultation. The latter has always worked with different law firms. It also lays the foundation of converting the leads into clients as you will be contacted by people who need legal advice. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="title">Set Up a Landing Page</p>
                    <p>
                        We have all seen these pages and have even subscribed to an email list through such pages. A landing page is designed for a specific purpose. In this case, your landing page should be designed to complement the lead magnet you are offering. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A landing page needs to explain the benefits of the lead magnet to the subscriber. It should also contain a summary of the contents in the lead magnet. Avoid revealing too much information to your readers. The best way to catch their attention is by using bullet points to highlight the benefits. You should also point out that the lead magnet is often sold, but you are offering it free to them. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Setting a deadline has proven to work most of the time. You can set a one-week deadline and use bold and colored letters to highlight the count down.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The landing page should also have an email collection form. Make it clear that the only way your readers can get the lead magnet is by subscribing to your email list. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="title">Invest in an Autoresponder</p>
                    <p>
                        If you know how useful an autoresponder is to your business, you will never neglect it. Fortunately, autoresponders are very affordable. You can invest in a decent email provider, and they will help you in setting up the autoresponder. The system automates email marketing campaigns and requires little maintenance. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All you need is to load an email sequence to the system, and it will send the emails per the requests. You can even use triggers, such as when someone subscribes, or when someone decides to contact you. You can later follow up with newsletters that are relevant to your readers. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="title">Have a Call Center</p>
                    <p>
                        After you get the contact, the next step is initiating a follow-up. Reaching out to people through emails is a viable option. However, it has been proven that phone calls convert lead to clients quickly. Make sure you schedule a time that will work for both of you. Make sure you ask the right questions and be prepared to answer any inquiries they may have. The only downside of this method is the cost you will incur. However, you can recover your costs if you can convert a third of your leads to clients. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="title">How can you Collect Leads?</p>
                    <p>
                        We have looked at the things that you must have to collect the leads and convert them to clients. Now let’s look at the process of collecting leads. The methods discussed below have proven to work all the time, and if you would implement them correctly, your business will never run out of leads. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="title">Buy Google Ads</p>
                    <p>
                        Google is one of the most prominent digital marketing firms today. It’s popular because of its search engine, which is the largest in the world. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many people prefer using Google Ads because of the tools and resources that will be available to them. The most important of them is the Google Keyword Planner. The tool helps you to research your keywords and see how they perform in the market. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Getting the right information about the keywords you are planning to target helps you to customize your ad campaign. You also get the keyword suggestions that will help to yield the same results. By combining these keywords, you are maximizing your market reach and improving the odds of reaching more people. Make sure you take advantage of this tool. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Google offers a coupon for free ads to their clients. However, you still need to spend around $50 to qualify for this coupon. The coupon will provide you with an opportunity to tweaking your ads without losing your money. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="title">Use Bing Ads</p>
                    <p>
                        Bing is a search engine, just like Google. The company also has the same digital marketing as Google. Even though it may not be as popular as Google, it does have high authority in the market. It’s also affordable compared to Google. 
                    </p>
